# Google books search
This is pet project for testing useSearchParams hook (and some more)
Is available on gh-pages (http://metalheadpnz.github.io/google-book-search)

## Available functions

Books search with google api. Show description of each book

### Advanced

Can go back from books description page and all results will stay in store

### TODO

1) add search params in url and realize link sending
2) cover reducer with JEST unit tests
3) a) show search header in book description (not sure if this is correct for UX)
   b) show each book in modal window, not new page ( and again - what is better UX?)
